seat reservation library

During covid time, it was difficult to reserve a seat in the library. Generally, before covid, the library had 380 seats to reserve and after covid only 75. 
Consequently, I was so frustrated because I was not able to reserve a seat every day. 
As a result, I wrote this code to have a seat every day. 

This code reserve a specific seat for a specific time, 7 days in advance. This is important because this code is faster in time in comparison with the normal user who wants to reserve a seat in the library. 

Finally, this code has a lot of limitations however it works properly for the reason that I wrote it.
